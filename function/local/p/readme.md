# Sea Eye Algorithm

```en
I know I have the body of a weak and feeble woman; 
but I have the heart and stomach of a king, and of a king of England too, 
and think foul scorn that Parma or Spain,
or any prince of Europe, 
should dare to invade the borders of my realm: to which rather than any dishonour shall grow by me, 
I myself will take up arms, 
I myself will be your general, judge, and rewarder of every one of your virtues in the field.
